# 🔐 LLM Red Team Pilot

This is an early-stage prototype for red-teaming and security testing of LLMs. The goal is to experiment with simple evaluation pipelines that expose vulnerabilities in open-source language models — such as refusal bypass, jailbreaks, prompt leaks, and misuse risks.

> ⚠️ This is a learning-focused, work-in-progress project. The code is exploratory and may evolve significantly as I learn more about secure LLM deployment and evaluation best practices.

## 📌 What It Does

* Loads and runs prompts across multiple local LLMs (Ollama-supported models like Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA).
* Compares model responses to adversarial prompts.
* Tags responses with basic heuristic risk categories.
* Optionally runs a self-critique step using a secondary model.
* Logs outputs to `.csv` and `.jsonl` for later analysis.

## 📒 Notes

* Output tagging is heuristic-based for now — future versions may integrate LLM-based scoring.
* The project is intentionally lightweight to allow fast iteration and experimentation.
* Contributions, feedback, or ideas are welcome!
